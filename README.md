# smb3
Disassembly of Super Mario Bros 3

Specifically for use with cc65 (https://github.com/cc65/cc65), this will reassemble into a byte-for-byte perfect clone of Super Mario Bros. 3 US (PRG1)

-------------

To assemble, simply run:

`make`

Intended for use for research into the inner workings of SMB3 and highly technical ROM hacks (such as Super Mario Bros. 3Mix)
